## to test this app please run pytest -s 

### I manipulated the tests a bit because I made my code work in a harder way. so please when you test write "pytest -s" and insert your adjectives ...etc as you like. but when it request to write words like dark and stormy night; please enter these words as is.

the video game results will be on a new file, and the "dark and stormy" will be changed on the same txt file

#### (pytest tests/test_series.py .) this is how we initialize our app, or (python module/series.py )
